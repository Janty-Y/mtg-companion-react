This App was a conversion project:
I had initially made this app using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
To get some practice converting existing apps, and some more practice with React in general, I decided to convert the original code to a React app.
The original code can be found at: https://github.com/Janty-Y/mtg-companion
