# MTG-Companion - React Version

- Live version can be found at: https://mtg-companion-react.herokuapp.com/

This App was a conversion project:

- I had initially made this app (Version 1.0) using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
- To get some practice converting existing apps, and some more practice with React in general, I decided to convert the original code to a React app.
- The original code can be found at: https://github.com/Janty-Y/mtg-companion
